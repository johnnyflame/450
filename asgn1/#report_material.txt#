    Ideas for randomization :
        
        -body type (dome or square)
        -Height
        -Orders (Number of columns in front and side
        -Size Of the pillars
        -The type of order (Ionian, Doric, Corinthian, Composite)
        -Fluted vs unfluted
        -Material/texture
        -woreness? (small probability that it is just a bunch of broken pillars, like the temple of Apollo)
